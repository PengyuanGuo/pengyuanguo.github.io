## Key Contributions

- Proposed and led the accepted project "A Visuo-tactile Diffusion Policy Architecture for Multimodal Imitation Learning" ([Proposal PDF](/files/WBCD%20Competition%20Proposal.pdf)), among 88 global submissions, with only 15 teams selected as finalists.
- Coordinated overall team efforts, managed communication with competition organizers, and successfully applied for a travel grant to support team participation.
- Contributed to real-world bimanual manipulation dataset collection in Zarr format; validated data quality via Rerun visualization and trained diffusion policies on the Gilbreth cluster.
- Designed and prototyped custom mechanical connectors in CAD, facilitating modular integration of multiple robotic arms, cameras, and grippers of heterogeneous models.
- Developed a ROS 1 teleoperation interface for Meta Quest 3 → Galaxea A1 robotic arm, enabling teleoperation as a backup plan.

I am a Master’s student in the Robotics program at the College of Engineering, Purdue University, advised by Prof. [She Yu](https://www.purduemars.com/people) . My research interests lie in robot learning, compositional generative modeling, and embodied agents.

Previously, I earned a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University.

I am a Master’s student in the Robotics program at the College of Engineering, [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by Prof. [Yu She](https://www.purduemars.com/people). I'm also collaborating with Prof. [Qiang Qiu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~qqiu/) on my AgenticLab project. My research interests lie in robot learning, compositional generative model, and Bio-inspired mechanism design.

Previously, I earned a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University.

Research Interests
======
- **Robot Learning and Embodied Intelligence:** Scalable robot learning paradigms based on vision, tactile, and 3D perception, emphasizing multimodal fusion for robust manipulation and control.

- **Reasoning, Planning, and Compositionality:** Exploring symbolic and task-level reasoning through PDDL-based planning, compositional representations, and reasoning–perception integration to enhance the generalization and adaptability of embodied agents.

- **Bio-inspired Mechanism Design & Interpretability:** Investigating the robust–adaptive axis in robotics by developing reconfigurable structures and interpretable learning systems that mimic biological strategies for resilience, specifically focusing on appendage loss compensation and visual fixation.
